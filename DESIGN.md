## Problem Statement

Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology in software development and it is the most-widely used one. It is known to increase productivity and it structures development in cycles of work called Sprint. A Sprint is usually of duration 2-4 weeks and is conducted by planning via tools such as JIRA software or Trello. As a part of scrum, everyday the team conducts daily meetings to take updates from the team members and the scrum master is the one who conducts and manages these meetings from the beginning to the end of a sprint. There exist 3 roles in a Scrum - Product Owner, Team, ScrumMaster. The ScrumMaster serves the team and helps the team learn and apply Scrum to achieve business value. 

Since a lot of meetings take place in a Scrum and there are multiple teams in any organization, the time and effort put in by a physically present ScrumMaster is quite a lot. The organization also has to invest effort and money to hire a good ScrumMaster. We thought of these are our project's main problems to solve and we intend to solve it by developing a Bot named 'Scrumster' that will be doing the tasks necessary to manage a Scrum. Many of the tasks will be automated and the things like moving tasks on the JIRA board or collecting updates from users will be much easier. With this the effort put in by the ScrumMaster as well as the Team members will be significantly reduced.
